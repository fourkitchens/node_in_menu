# node-in-menu
Provides a Views filter that filters nodes by whether they are referenced in a specific menu.

### Overview
This module adds a Views filter called "In menu" to node-based Views. It lets you restrict results to nodes that have a menu link in a chosen menu, matching either direct node links or links that point to the node via a path alias.

### Requirements
- **Drupal core**: 10.x or 11.x
- **Core modules**: `views`, `menu_link_content`, `path`

### Installation
- Enable the module like any other Drupal module.
  - UI: Extend â†’ search for "Node in Menu" and enable it.
  - Drush: `drush en node_in_menu -y`

### Usage
1. Create or edit a View of type **Content**.
2. In the View, under **Filter criteria**, click **Add** and search for **In menu**.
3. Add the filter and select the target **Menu** from the dropdown.
4. Save the View. The results will now only include nodes that have an enabled menu link in the selected menu.

### How it works
- Registers a Views filter plugin `@ViewsFilter("node_in_menu")` and exposes it on the `node_field_data` base table.
- The filter adds an `EXISTS` subquery against `menu_link_content_data`, also checking `path_alias` so links via aliases are matched.

### Compatibility notes
- Works on node-based Views (base table `node`/`node_field_data`).
- Expects the core `menu_link_content` and `path` modules to be enabled.

### Limitations
- Only checks for enabled menu links in the chosen menu.
- Does not currently support filtering by multiple menus at once.

### Development
- Code is PSR-4 under `src/` and the Views integration lives in `node_in_menu.views.inc`.
- Run `drush cr` after enabling or making code changes to rebuild caches.
